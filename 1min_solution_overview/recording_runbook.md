# Recording Runbook (Science-First Overview)

## Build Order

1. Open `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/slides_outline.md`.
2. Build the five slides with one scientific point per slide.
3. Paste notes from `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/speaker_notes_by_slide.md`.
4. Capture visuals listed in `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/assets/shot_list.md`.
5. Run fact-check gate using `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/assets/evidence_table.md`.

## Rehearsal Order

1. Rehearsal pass A: read exactly from `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/script_60s.md`.
2. Rehearsal pass B: deliver naturally with same technical nouns and numbers.
3. Timing target: 55-65 seconds.
4. Script word target: 130-150 words.

## Fact-Check Gate (Must Pass Before Final Record)

1. Confirm all numeric claims in script/slides are listed in `assets/evidence_table.md`.
2. Confirm top real score is stated as `31.63214`.
3. Confirm `predicted_mean` is not presented as final leaderboard truth.
4. Confirm probe references are explicitly labeled non-lineage.
5. Confirm status timestamp wording is explicit: `2026-02-22 19:00:30 UTC`.
