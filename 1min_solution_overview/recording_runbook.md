# Recording Runbook (Consolidated)

## Build Sequence

1. Read `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/story_and_science.md` for technical grounding.
2. Build slides directly from `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/presentation_packet.md`.
3. Capture visuals from `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/assets/shot_list.md`.
4. Verify each number/claim in `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/assets/evidence_table.md`.

## Rehearsal Sequence

1. Read the timestamped script in `presentation_packet.md` verbatim.
2. Run a natural pass using the speaker notes in the same file.
3. Timing gate: 55-65 seconds.
4. Script gate: 130-150 words.

## Fact-Check Gate (Mandatory)

1. Top real score appears as `31.63214`.
2. Baseline and uplift references are correct (`30.14024`, `30.79062`).
3. `predicted_mean 31.19849999999999` is clearly labeled as estimate.
4. Probe rows (`constant100`, `constant200`) are explicitly non-lineage.
5. Status timestamp is explicit where used (`2026-02-22 19:00:30 UTC`).

## Export Settings

- MP4, 1920x1080, 30 fps, AAC audio.
- Output name: `autohdr_1min_solution_overview_v1.mp4`.

## Retake Triggers

- Any wrong numeric value or timestamp.
- Predicted-vs-real confusion.
- Missing real-vs-probe separation.
- Runtime outside 55-65 seconds.
- Unclear on-slide readability.
