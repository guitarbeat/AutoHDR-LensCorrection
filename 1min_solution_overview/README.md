## Start Here

1. Open `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/quick_video.md`.
2. Build 5 slides using the listed figure paths.
3. Read the timestamped script as written.
4. Keep total runtime in the 55-65 second window.

## Figures

All ready-to-use figures are in:

Regenerate figures if needed:

```bash
python /Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/assets/build_figures.py
```

If your external originals are mounted in a different location:

```bash
python /Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/assets/build_figures.py --test-originals-dir "/path/to/test-originals"
```
