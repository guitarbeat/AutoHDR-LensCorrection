# 1-Minute Science Overview of AutoHDR Solution

## Purpose

Create a science-first 60-second explanation of:
1. how the real top solution works,
2. what experiments were tried and why outcomes differed,
3. how governance guardrails protect scientific validity.

## Start Here

1. Build slides from `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/slides_outline.md`.
2. Paste narration notes from `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/speaker_notes_by_slide.md`.
3. Capture evidence visuals from `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/assets/shot_list.md`.
4. Validate claims via `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/assets/evidence_table.md`.
5. Rehearse and export using `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/recording_runbook.md`.

## Hard Constraints

- Runtime must be 55-65 seconds.
- Script must be 130-150 words.
- No unverified numeric claims.
- Predicted oracle metrics must be labeled as estimates, not final leaderboard truth.

## Guardrail

Only ZIP-backed lineage counts as real.
