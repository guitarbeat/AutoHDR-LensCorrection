# 1-Minute Science Overview of AutoHDR Solution

## Purpose

Deliver a smooth, science-first 60-second explanation of:
1. how the top real ZIP-backed solution works,
2. what experiments were run and what changed the score trajectory,
3. how governance checks protect scientific validity.

## Quick Start

1. Read `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/story_and_science.md`.
2. Build and narrate from `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/presentation_packet.md`.
3. Capture visuals from `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/assets/shot_list.md`.
4. Verify every claim in `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/assets/evidence_table.md`.
5. Record/export using `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/1min_solution_overview/recording_runbook.md`.

## Hard Constraints

- Runtime: 55-65 seconds.
- Script length: 130-150 words.
- No unverified numeric claims.
- `predicted_mean` must be presented as an estimate, not final leaderboard truth.

## Guardrail

Only ZIP-backed lineage counts as real.
