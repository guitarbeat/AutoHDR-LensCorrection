# Deprecated: Use Dashboard + Log

This file is retained only as a pointer for prior agent workflows.

Canonical docs:

- Live dashboard: `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/plan.md`
- Append-only operations log: `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/docs/ops/log.md`

Agent handoff rule:

- Update `plan.md` for live operational state.
- Append evidence, postmortems, and scored-run notes to `docs/ops/log.md`.
