# AutoHDR Documentation Index

Use this page as the entry point for all docs.

## Canonical (Current)

1. Competition closeout dashboard:

2. Append-only operations log:
   - `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/docs/ops/log.md`
3. Real vs probe submission lineage:

4. Human-readable journey timeline (presentation-ready):

## Operational Support

1. Invalidation follow-up notes:
   - `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/docs/ops/invalidation_followup_20260222_1828.md`

## Archived / Legacy Context (Preserved)

1. Historical long-form plan narrative:
   - `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/docs/archive/plan_2.md`
2. Final-hours execution brain snapshot:
   - `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/docs/archive/execution_brain_20260222_snapshot.md`

## Consolidation Policy

1. Do not create new top-level docs when an existing canonical doc fits.
2. Add run evidence to `/Users/aaron/Desktop/AutoHDR/docs/ops/log.md` (append-only).
3. Keep old docs as archived references; do not delete narrative history.
